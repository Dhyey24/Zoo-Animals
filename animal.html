                    Ollie the Playful Bear üêª<br>
                    <li>Ollie is a young, energetic brown bear who loves to climb trees and
                        splash around in the pond at the zoo. Always curious, he enjoys playing
                        with visitors by standing on his hind legs and waving. His favorite treat
                        is honey-covered apples, and he often gets into trouble trying to find
                        extra snacks.</li>
                    Mona the Gentle Giant üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è<br>
                    <li>Mona is a calm and wise polar bear who loves to lounge by the water and
                        watch over Ollie like an older sibling. She enjoys swimming gracefully in
                        her icy pool and sunbathing on the rocks. Though she looks serious, she has
                        a soft spot for fish-shaped ice treats and belly rubs from her caretakers.</li>
                    <li>Together, Ollie and Mona are the zoo‚Äôs most beloved bears, delighting
                        visitors with their playful antics and heartwarming friendship!</li>
