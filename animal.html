                    Ollie the Playful Bear üêª
                    <li>Ollie is a young, energetic brown bear who loves to climb trees and
                        splash around in the pond at the zoo. Always curious, he enjoys playing
                        with visitors by standing on his hind legs and waving. His favorite treat
                        is honey-covered apples, and he often gets into trouble trying to find
                        extra snacks.</li>
                    <br>Mona the Gentle Giant üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è<br>
                    <li>Mona is a calm and wise polar bear who loves to lounge by the water and
                        watch over Ollie like an older sibling. She enjoys swimming gracefully in
                        her icy pool and sunbathing on the rocks. Though she looks serious, she has
                        a soft spot for fish-shaped ice treats and belly rubs from her caretakers.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Together, Ollie and Mona are the zoo‚Äôs most beloved bears, delighting

                    Frankie the Flamboyant Giraffe ü¶í
                    <li>Frankie is a tall, spotted giraffe with a vibrant personality to match his
                        height. Always the life of the zoo, he loves showing off his long neck by
                        reaching for the highest leaves and playfully teasing the other animals. He‚Äôs
                        known for his dramatic head tilts and curious nature, often leaning over the
                        fence to get a better view of zoo visitors. Frankie‚Äôs favorite activity?
                        Flipping his ears to the rhythm of the zoo‚Äôs music during special events!</li>
                    <br>Coconut the Chill Giraffe ü¶í
                    <li>Coconut is a laid-back, easygoing giraffe with a calm demeanor. She prefers
                        to take life slowly, munching on leaves in the shade and taking long,
                        leisurely naps under the big oak tree. Her unique name comes from the fact
                        that she loves to nibble on coconuts whenever the zookeepers bring them in
                        as a special treat. While Frankie is always in the spotlight, Coconut is the
                        grounding presence who keeps things peaceful in their enclosure.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Together, Frankie and Coconut make the perfect pair‚ÄîFrankie adds the flair,
                        while Coconut brings the serenity!</li>

                    Mella the Fierce and Fearless ü¶Å
                    <li>Mella is a strong and confident lioness with a golden coat that shines under
                        the sun. She is the leader of the pride at the zoo, always keeping a watchful
                        eye on her surroundings. Known for her speed and agility, Mella loves to chase
                        after her favorite toy‚Äîa big red ball‚Äîwhen she‚Äôs feeling playful. Though she‚Äôs
                        fierce, she has a soft side for her caretakers and enjoys gentle head rubs after
                        a good meal.</li>

                        Unlike Mella, he prefers to take things slow, often lounging on the highest rock
                        in the enclosure while soaking up the sun. He lets Mella do most of the work when
                        it comes to playing, but when it‚Äôs time to roar, Karl makes sure the whole zoo
                        hears him. His favorite pastime? Taking long afternoon naps and getting treats
                        from the zookeepers.</li>

                    Cookie the Clever Monkey üêµ
                    <li>Cookie is the brains of the monkey trio, always coming up with clever ways to
                        outsmart the zookeepers (especially when it comes to sneaking extra snacks). She‚Äôs
                        quick, mischievous, and loves solving puzzles. Her favorite treat is, of course,
                        cookies‚Äîespecially banana-flavored ones! She‚Äôs often seen swinging from branch to
                        branch, plotting her next playful prank.</li>
                    <br>Earl the Goofy Monkey üêí

                        his silly faces and funny dances. He loves attention and will do just about anything
                        to get a reaction from visitors‚Äîwhether it's hanging upside down, making funny noises,
                        or clapping his hands excitedly. Earl‚Äôs favorite pastime? Playing peekaboo with kids
                        who come to visit!</li>

                        affectionate of the trio. She‚Äôs known for her big, curious eyes and her habit of hugging
                        zookeepers whenever she gets a tasty banana treat. While Cookie and Earl get into
                        trouble, Banana Pudding prefers to cuddle up in a warm spot and watch the fun unfold.</li>
                    <br>

                    <li>Wren is the bold and fearless leader of the alligator trio. With sharp eyes and
                        a strong presence, she commands attention in the zoo‚Äôs swampy enclosure. She
                        loves basking in the sun on her favorite rock but is always the first to slip into
                        the water when it‚Äôs time to hunt for snacks. Wren is smart, strategic, and never
                        backs down from a challenge.</li>
                    <br>Aspen the Silent Watcher üêä
                    <li>Aspen is the quiet and mysterious one, often seen floating motionless in the water
                        with just his eyes peeking above the surface. While he may seem distant, he‚Äôs always
                        observing everything around him. He prefers to conserve his energy and strike only
                        when necessary, making him the best hunter of the group. Aspen‚Äôs favorite meal? Fresh
                        fish straight from the zookeepers!</li>
                    <br>Mika the Playful One üêä
                    <li>Unlike her serious friends, Mika is surprisingly playful for an alligator! She enjoys
                        splashing around in the water, chasing floating leaves, and even nudging zookeepers
                        gently for treats. She may not be the biggest or the strongest, but she has the biggest
                        heart. Mika loves the occasional belly rub (if you dare!) and is the most social of the
                        three.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Together, Wren, Aspen, and Mika create the perfect balance‚Äîstrength, stealth, and
                        a little bit of fun in their swampy kingdom!</li>
