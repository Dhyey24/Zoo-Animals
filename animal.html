                    Ollie the Playful Bear üêª
                    <li>Ollie is a young, energetic brown bear who loves to climb trees and
                        splash around in the pond at the zoo. Always curious, he enjoys playing
                        with visitors by standing on his hind legs and waving. His favorite treat
                        is honey-covered apples, and he often gets into trouble trying to find
                        extra snacks.</li>
                    Mona the Gentle Giant üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è<br>
                    <li>Mona is a calm and wise polar bear who loves to lounge by the water and
                        watch over Ollie like an older sibling. She enjoys swimming gracefully in
                        her icy pool and sunbathing on the rocks. Though she looks serious, she has
                        a soft spot for fish-shaped ice treats and belly rubs from her caretakers.</li>
                    <li>Together, Ollie and Mona are the zoo‚Äôs most beloved bears, delighting
                        visitors with their playful antics and heartwarming friendship!</li>

                    Frankie the Flamboyant Giraffe ü¶í
                    <li>Frankie is a tall, spotted giraffe with a vibrant personality to match his
                        height. Always the life of the zoo, he loves showing off his long neck by
                        reaching for the highest leaves and playfully teasing the other animals. He‚Äôs
                        known for his dramatic head tilts and curious nature, often leaning over the
                        fence to get a better view of zoo visitors. Frankie‚Äôs favorite activity?
                        Flipping his ears to the rhythm of the zoo‚Äôs music during special events!</li>
                    Coconut the Chill Giraffe ü¶í
                    <li>Coconut is a laid-back, easygoing giraffe with a calm demeanor. She prefers
                        to take life slowly, munching on leaves in the shade and taking long,
                        leisurely naps under the big oak tree. Her unique name comes from the fact
                        that she loves to nibble on coconuts whenever the zookeepers bring them in
                        as a special treat. While Frankie is always in the spotlight, Coconut is the
                        grounding presence who keeps things peaceful in their enclosure.</li>
                    <li>Together, Frankie and Coconut make the perfect pair‚ÄîFrankie adds the flair,
                        while Coconut brings the serenity!</li>

                    Mella the Fierce and Fearless ü¶Å
                    <li>Mella is a strong and confident lioness with a golden coat that shines under 
                        the sun. She is the leader of the pride at the zoo, always keeping a watchful 
                        eye on her surroundings. Known for her speed and agility, Mella loves to chase 
                        after her favorite toy‚Äîa big red ball‚Äîwhen she‚Äôs feeling playful. Though she‚Äôs 
                        fierce, she has a soft side for her caretakers and enjoys gentle head rubs after 
                        a good meal.</li>
                    Karl the Laid-Back King ü¶Å
                    <li>CKarl is a majestic male lion with a thick, dark mane that makes him look regal. 
                        Unlike Mella, he prefers to take things slow, often lounging on the highest rock 
                        in the enclosure while soaking up the sun. He lets Mella do most of the work when 
                        it comes to playing, but when it‚Äôs time to roar, Karl makes sure the whole zoo 
                        hears him. His favorite pastime? Taking long afternoon naps and getting treats 
                        from the zookeepers.</li>
                    <li>Together, Mella and Karl balance each other out‚Äîone is the fearless hunter, and t
                        he other is the relaxed ruler of their kingdom!</li>
