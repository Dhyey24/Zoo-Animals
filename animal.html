                    Ollie the Playful Bear 🐻
                    <li>Ollie is a young, energetic brown bear who loves to climb trees and
                        splash around in the pond at the zoo. Always curious, he enjoys playing
                        with visitors by standing on his hind legs and waving. His favorite treat
                        is honey-covered apples, and he often gets into trouble trying to find
                        extra snacks.</li>
                    Mona the Gentle Giant 🐻‍❄️<br>
                    <li>Mona is a calm and wise polar bear who loves to lounge by the water and
                        watch over Ollie like an older sibling. She enjoys swimming gracefully in
                        her icy pool and sunbathing on the rocks. Though she looks serious, she has
                        a soft spot for fish-shaped ice treats and belly rubs from her caretakers.</li>
                    <li>Together, Ollie and Mona are the zoo’s most beloved bears, delighting
                        visitors with their playful antics and heartwarming friendship!</li>

                    Frankie the Flamboyant Giraffe 🦒
                    <li>Frankie is a tall, spotted giraffe with a vibrant personality to match his
                        height. Always the life of the zoo, he loves showing off his long neck by
                        reaching for the highest leaves and playfully teasing the other animals. He’s
                        known for his dramatic head tilts and curious nature, often leaning over the
                        fence to get a better view of zoo visitors. Frankie’s favorite activity?
                        Flipping his ears to the rhythm of the zoo’s music during special events!</li>
                    Coconut the Chill Giraffe 🦒
                    <li>Coconut is a laid-back, easygoing giraffe with a calm demeanor. She prefers
                        to take life slowly, munching on leaves in the shade and taking long,
                        leisurely naps under the big oak tree. Her unique name comes from the fact
                        that she loves to nibble on coconuts whenever the zookeepers bring them in
                        as a special treat. While Frankie is always in the spotlight, Coconut is the
                        grounding presence who keeps things peaceful in their enclosure.</li>
                    <li>Together, Frankie and Coconut make the perfect pair—Frankie adds the flair,
                        while Coconut brings the serenity!</li>
